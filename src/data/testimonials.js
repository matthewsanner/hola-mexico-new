    text: "It's been a life long goal for me to learn Spanish - so much so that in 2022 I physically moved to Mexico City to “force” myself to immerse in the language. I met Ernesto 3 weeks after moving, and I've been working with him consistently since then, y ahora puedo conversar en español con fluidez!",

    text: "I've been taking classes with Hola Mexico for over five years, both in person and online. We always discuss a variety of topics, and it's more like talking to a friend (who gives me advice on which words to use). The class is personalized if you have a specific vocabulary or subject you'd like to learn. We also practice vocabulary from various situations. I really enjoy it.",
